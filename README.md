# Eco_Temp: Intelligent HVAC Optimization

## Problem Statement

The **Eco_Temp** project focuses on optimizing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to enhance energy efficiency while maintaining user comfort. Traditional HVAC systems operate based on static schedules or limited sensor data, leading to inefficient energy use and poor adaptation to dynamic environmental or occupancy changes.

### Key Challenges:
- Excessive energy consumption due to inefficiency
- Lack of real-time adjustments based on occupancy or environmental data
- Difficulty balancing energy savings with user comfort
- Limited adaptability to varying weather conditions or indoor environments

**Eco_Temp** addresses these challenges using AI-driven optimization to regulate HVAC systems based on real-time data from environmental and occupancy sensors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system intelligently adjusts temperature settings to minimize energy usage while ensuring user comfort.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and models for **Eco_Temp: Intelligent HVAC Optimization**, an AI-powered system designed to optimize HVAC performance by:
- Collecting and analyzing real-time data from various environmental and occupancy sensors.
- Using machine learning algorithms to predict optimal temperature settings.
- Adjusting the HVAC system dynamically to balance energy efficiency and comfort.

The project aims to reduce energy consumption, lower operational costs, and provide a better environment for occupants by ensuring optimal temperature conditions.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Temperature Optimization**: Uses predictive algorithms to adjust temperature based on occupancy, external weather conditions, and other environmental factors.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously collects data from temperature, humidity, and occupancy sensors for instant adjustments.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Helps reduce energy usage by only adjusting the HVAC system when necessary, resulting in potential cost savings.
- **User Comfort**: Ensures optimal indoor conditions by considering both energy savings and comfort preferences.

## Requirements

To run the model, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras (for machine learning model)
